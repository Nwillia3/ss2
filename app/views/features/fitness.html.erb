				<h3> What is a Saiyan?</h3>		
			<p>A Saiyan is a warrior that does not quit. Saiyans push themselves to their limit. When a Saiyan fails, she becomes stronger and wiser as a result of learning from her mistakes. Saiyans are determined, hardworking and most importantly compassionate individuals. They help those in need. 
			</p>	

			<h3>How does Saiyan Works?</h3>

			Before your first session, we pair you with one of our Saiyan physical therapists to review your body functionality. 
			2. Review PT recommendations
			Read over the brief our PT has sent you regarding your phyiscal.
			3. Book Personal training sessions with Saiyan. 
			You can manually choose a personal trainer or have one recommended to you. 
			4. Begin your journey to become a Saiyan. 
			</p>

			<h3>How much does Saiyan cost?</h3>
			<p>While most gyms mark up the prices of personal trainers, we offer Personal Training at $40/hr and $25 30min sessions. </p>

			<h3>Do you take insurance for physical therapy?</h3>
			<p>We are not contracted with any insurance providers at this time. We offer comparable to the out-of-pocket co-pays and deductibles you would pay at conventional clinics.
			</p>

			<h3>Can I stick with the same trainer?</h3>
			<p>You are more than capable of continuing your workout sessions with the same trainer. Just select a date and time that the trainer has available!</p>
